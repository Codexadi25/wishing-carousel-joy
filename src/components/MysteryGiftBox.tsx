  const poem = `In the code of this universe, 
We met in hevenly realm,
We laughed together, shared humor too.
Our ambitions align, our aspirations too,
You fear to dive in, as I fear flaws anew.
I know your love, your ambition, as I love you,
Your voice, my solace, helped me move through.
You inspire my poetry, let me write for you,
You wake me early, with dreams so true.
You keep me awake in sleepless nights,
You perfect my life, in all its lights.
Let me be the reason for your every delight,
My life devoted to you, in day and night.
I dream of you with desperation, every time,
Your voice, my melody, in every rhyme.
Proposing in paradox, my love so prime,
In the syntax of my heart, you are the line.
In this code of love, you are my choice,
Your laughter, my debug, your voice, my rejoice.
In the binary of dreams, you are the one,
Together, forever, under moon and sun.
I compile my thoughts, they lead to you,
In this algorithm of life, our love is true.
Your voice, the melody of my keyboard's song,
In this infinite loop, where we belong.
So here I propose, in this code so pure,
With you, my love, I am always sure.
A paradox of love, in every byte,
Together, forever, in the day and night.`;
